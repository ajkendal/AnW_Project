            	Precision Regal 300 display console can measure weights in pounds or 
                kilograms with the push of a button, has a 300 lb. (136 kg) capacity. 
                The easy-to-read LCD screen displays weights to the nearest 0.1 lbs. or 0.1 kg. 
                with ±1% accuracy. The scale is touch-activated with autoshut-off. The mounting 
                bracket allows the console to be mounted to a horizontal or vertical surface 
            	and tilted to make LCD Screen easier to see.
            </p>
            <p>
            	A reinforced, 1-piece, fully-welded stainless steel-covered frame creates 
                the strongest, most rigid platform scale available.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Stainless Steel motionless platform is supported by a load cell in each corner, 
                with self-aligning floor pads to insure accuracy on most floors. State-of-the-art 
                electronics take load readings from all four corner-mounted load cells to get the
                most accurate weight even if the animal is placed off center. Platform’s 12-ft. 
                (3.66m) long datacable plugs into the console. Many less expensive scales take 
                readings from only one or two load cells and the platform is not motionless.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Hold button on the console allows you to lock in an electronically-averaged 
                weight for restless animals to keep the reading from “jumping around.” 
                The Regal 300 also features a Tare function to compensate for the extraweight 
                when an animal is weighed inside a carrier or held by its owner.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The Regal 300 Scale is truly portable while operating with its’ built-in 
                6-v. rechargeable battery or it can be continuously powered by leaving the 
                battery’s charger plugged in.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Non-slip rubber mat gives anxious animals better traction, and removes easily 
                for cleaning. Display console may be mounted on the optional mounting column, 
                on a wall or cabinet above the scale, or in a remote location. A 12-foot (3.66m) 
                long cable is included.
